## CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION

### Goal in Context

### Scope

Organization.

### Level

Primary task.

### Preconditions

The demographic researcher has authorized access to the system, which includes the features to extract the required data from its updated World database.

### Successful End Condition

### Primary Actor

Demographic Researcher

### Trigger

The organization requests the demographic researcher to make a report on what are the most populated and least populated cities in a country.


## MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO

2. The system is activated to get access to the World database, and the name of a country is inserted as an input.

3. The system extracts and sorts only the data related to all the cities within a specified country from its database.

4. The system generates a table of cities sorted from largest population to smallest within that specified country.
